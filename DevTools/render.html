browsers render websites

A web browser is a piece of software that loads files from a remote server (or perhaps a local disk) and displays them to you — allowing for user interaction.
However, within a browser there exists a piece of software called the browser engine.

The browser engine is a core software component of every major browser, and different browser manufacturers call their
engines by different names.

The browser engine for :
 - Firefox is called Gecko,
 - Chrome is called Blink (fork de Webkit)
