Welcome to JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages on earth and is used to add interactivity to webpages, 
process data, as well as create various applications(mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and more)


The document.write() function writes a string into our HTML document. This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both.
The document.write() method should be used only for testing. Other output mechanisms appear in the upcoming lessons.

Js inside <body> 
It's a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the <body> element.
This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.

Variables 
- JavaScript is case sensitive. 
- A variable can be declared without a value
- A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
- In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is called the "assignment"
-  "equal to" 
- JavaScript variable names are case-sensitiv

BASIC COMPONENTS

1) Naming Variables
- Naming rules:
  - The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
  - Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
  - JavaScript names must not contain spaces.

  No usar special symbols,
  my#num, num%, etc. y no usar palabras reservadas.

2) Data Types
  - Numbers
  - strings 
    // con ''backslash (\) escape character : caracteres de escapeca
    var sayHello = 'Hello world! \'I am a JavaScript programmer.\' ';
    document.write(sayHello);

  - arrays

3) Arithmetic Operators
You can get the result of a string expression using the eval() function, 
which takes a string expression argument like eval("10 * 20 + 8") and returns the result. 
If the argument is empty, it returns undefined.

Multiplication
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies one number by the other.
